## My process

### Built with

- HTML divs and img
- settin
- CSS properties
  - Used flexbox to position the card in center.
  - Used class based styling
  - Used padding for spacings

### What I learned

I learnt to work on design withour looking in figma or any design doc. It is a good practice to identify the properties of any UI by looking at it's image only.


Proud of centering the div on screen üòÅ

```css
.card-wrapper {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to work more on responsiveness of any design.
